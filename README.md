### 1. Project explanation ###

        This project is the idle clicker game which you play as the swordmaster whose object is to kill the monsters
    by click at them. When a monster die you got a gold. Gold use for upgrade your sword for a better damage , buy skills
    for easier game play (Like double damage or critical) and hire a friends to help you fight with the monster (friend is auto attacking).

### 2. Design Pattern ###

    2.1) Factory Pattern
        - MonsterFactory
        - FriendFactory
    
        Use index for create a monster or friend instead of call its classes itself.
    
    2.2) Strategy Pattern
        - SkillHero
        - DoubleDamage_Skill
        - Critical_Skill
    
        A SkillHero interface use to represent those 2 concrete class that do similar thing.
    
    2.3) State Pattern
        - PlayState
        - SkillMenuState
        - FriendMenuState
        - ListSkillMenuState
        - MenuState
    
        A State for swaping menu bar etc.
    
    2.4) Observer Pattern
        - PlayState
        - SkillHero
        - TextDmg
        - TextDmgPool
    
        These classes update in the playstate for real time update in game.
    
    2.5) Flyweight Pattern
        - MyFriend
        - All classes in package friends
    
        These classes implements the MyFriend interface and use the same method when use in other classes.
    
### 3. Design Principle ###

    GRASP
        Creator : 
            - PlayState create Player
            - PlayState create monster
            - Player create Skill
            - TextDmgPool create TextDmg
            
        Information Expert :
            - MonsterFactory have all monster
            - PlayState have player , monsterfactory , hpbar, textdmg,etc.
        
        Low Coupling :
            - We Seperate skill classes (DoubleDamage_Skill,Critical_Skill).
            - We Use MonsterFactory to create monster so Playstate cant affect monster.
        
        Polymorphism :
            - SkillHero Have Concrete classes DoubleDamage_Skill and Critical_Skill.
            - MyFriend Have Concrete classes Legolas,Frodo,Gimli,Gandalf,Aragon,Saruman
            
        Controller :
            - Playstate control game play in usual way.
            - SkillMenuState control skills bought.
            - FriendMenuState control friends hired.
            - ListSkillMenuState control skills used.
